Instead of just setting a timer, it creates a complete environment for deep work, helping you eliminate distractions and maximize concentration. Users can customize work and break intervals, set daily goals, and track how many sessions they complete each day. Detailed statistics help you monitor your focus habits over time and identify areas where you can improve. The interface is minimalistic and calming, reducing cognitive load so you can concentrate fully on your tasks. Gentle notifications remind you when to start, pause, or resume, helping maintain a healthy rhythm between work and rest. The app integrates task lists with Pomodoro timers, allowing each task to be assigned to a specific session for better organization. Built-in analytics show both total work time and which tasks consume the most energy, aiding efficiency improvement.
